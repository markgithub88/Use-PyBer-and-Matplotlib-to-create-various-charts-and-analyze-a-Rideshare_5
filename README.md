ANALYSIS
My analysis of the purpose of this project.  The purpose of this project was to create visualizations using our various new tools like Matplotlib, data frames, bubble charts, calculating statistics, showing percentages of total fares rides and drivers.


# Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

RESULTS.
Studying the various charts that we created I noticed that the rural ride was very expensive compared to suburban and urban. Rural rides were also very few compared to the other two types. It also appears that most of the rides occurred during pre-work and after work hours. Urban consistently had the highest total rides total drivers total fares and the like. The suburban City type was always in the middle.


# Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
SUMMARY
To the CEO I would make three recommendations. One. Provide more drivers for suburban and urban riders, Two.  The beginning of March by looking at our total fair by City type chart, is a slow season for you plan accordingly.  Three.  April seems to be high rides along into May and probably June in the summertime as well. Be sure to have enough drivers during the summer months.

Thank you,
Mark
